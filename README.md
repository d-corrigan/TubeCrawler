### Intent
This code was developed to retrieve large quantities of videos of any kind
Adding a starting URL about a certain subject (i.e. Kittens, French Bulldogs or Area 51)
will result in the collection of several videos similar to the original as thats where I retrieve the links to crawl to next.

There are default URL's built in to start with and once duplicates begin to slow things down it randomly selects a new URL to crawl.   

There is also a csv file thats created that offers some other information based on the videos collected.
